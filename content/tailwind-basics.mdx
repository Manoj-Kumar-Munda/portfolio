## Introduction
Welcome to the Introduction! In this series, we'll explore the fundamentals of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that has revolutionized the way we build modern web applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this series will provide you with valuable insights and practical examples to enhance your understanding of Tailwind CSS.

## What is Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs directly in their HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide pre-designed components, Tailwind offers a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to create unique designs without writing custom CSS. This approach promotes rapid development and encourages a more consistent design system.

## Installation
To get started with Tailwind CSS, you can install it via npm or yarn. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to setting it up in your project:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```
