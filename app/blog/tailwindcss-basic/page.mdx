## Introduction to Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs directly in their HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS offers a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to create unique and responsive designs. This approach promotes rapid development and encourages a more maintainable codebase by reducing the need for custom CSS.
In the next section, we'll walk through the process of setting up Tailwind CSS in your project. Stay tuned!
